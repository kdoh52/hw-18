# Homework 18: Budget Tracker (PWAs)

## Description
This website application allows a user to track their earnings and expenses by inputting them into a NoSQL database where they are then displayed graphically. This is a Progressive Web App (PWA), so even if the user adds to the database without an internet connection, it will be added later when the connection returns.
